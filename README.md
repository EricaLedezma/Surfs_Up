## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to look at the historical data of temperature to determine if Oahu would be a good place to open the ice cream shop. Since ice cream tends to be eaten more when the temps are higher, they are looking for someplace that, on average, had good ice cream eating temperatures.

## Results
We wanted to see what the difference in temperature was for the month of June (middle of summer) and December (middle of winter). Here are the results from the historical data:

- Average temperatures for the month of June are 74.9 degrees and the average temperatures for the month of December are 71 degrees. There is only about a 4 degree difference between the two months.

- The temperatures in December can get as cold at 56 degrees. However, for the most part, the temperatures range from 69 degrees to 74 degrees.

- The temperatures for June can get as high as 85 degrees. However, for the most part, the temperatures range from 73 degrees to 77 degrees

## Summary

Based on the historical data, there is not much difference in temperature between the two months, the difference is less than 10 degrees (69-77). If we are looking for a place that has perfect temperatures year-round, Oahu would be the place!

To further solidify Oahu as the spot for the ice cream shop, we should perform some analysis on the following:
- See how much it rains in the potential area of the ice cream shop. There are parts of Hawaii where is constantly rains, may want to avoid a wetter area.
- Analyze Q1 (March) and Q3 (September) to see if they align with Q2 (June) and Q4 (Decmeber) analysis we did. Just to ensure the temps are within the same range all year long.
